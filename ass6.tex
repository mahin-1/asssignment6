    \begin{frame}{Question}
        \textbf{Papoulis book exercise 5}\\
        \large \noindent Q-15 A fair coin is tossed 10 times and x equals the number of heads.
        
        (a) Find $F_x(x)$.
        
        (b) Find $F_y(y)$ if $y = (x-3)^2$.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Solution}
    (a) The random variable x takes the value $k = 0,1,2,.....,10$ and \\
     \hspace{5mm}$P(x=k) = p_k = {10\choose k}\dfrac{1}{2^{10}}$ \hspace{5mm} $0\leq k \leq 10$
    
    $F_x(x)$ is a staircase function with discontinuities at the points $x=k$ and jumps equal to $P_k$.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Solution}
    
    (b) The random variable $y = (x - 3)^3$
    takes the value $y = k^2$ for $k = 0,1,.....,7$ and probabilities $P\{y = k^2\} = q_K$.
